                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Eden! I'm currently studying management information 
                    systems with minors in nonprofit management and cybersecurity. 
                    I plan to graduate in May 2027, and after that I'd love to 
                    get a job in anything regarding IT management!
                </p>
                <p>Some other fun facts about me:
                </p>
                <ul><li>My favorite foods are rice and chocolate, but not together lol!</li>
                <li>I love Jesus, family, music, writing, and filming.</li>
                <li>On the side, I am a birth doula and the vice president of 
                    a media/TV ministry.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>PS: I didn't realize how much I missed HTML and CSS 
                    after not working with them for 2 years... until I 
                    started on this project. Therefore, as you can see, I 
                    went all out and just had fun with it :)
