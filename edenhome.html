                <h2>I Could Be a CEO</h2>
                <h5>Wednesday, September 4, 2025 @ 11:13am</h5>
                <p>I never thought I would have ended up doing what I am 
                    today - and I never would have thought that I would 
                    like it. But here we are... and I love it more each 
                    day.
                </p>
                <p>Especially when my classes start teaching me how to 
                    be a CEO :)
                </p>
                <p>The following are some thoughts from my journal a few 
                    months ago:
                </p>
                <p>June 10, 2025 - I was studying my doula continuing ed and 
                    recertification, and thinking back to 3 years ago when I 
                    first began the doula course. And I realized, wow, since 
                    then I've learned how to study and I've learned to love, 
                    genuinely love, school! I think as a child I had such an 
                    overactive mind that school wasn't really a mental challenge 
                    as much as it was an irritation; something to be merely 
                    tolerated. It just kept my brain quiet when I was a kid. 
                    Now, however, I've finally gotten to the point where it's actually 
                    expanding my brain and teaching me new thoughts and how to think. 
                    School is actually finally challenging my mental powers and 
                    capacity. And I actually love it! But the other thing is, I 
                    realized something else this past semester when I realized 
                    I'm going to graduate with a major, two minors, and a few 
                    certifications to boot: yes, I hate materialism which includes 
                    letters after my name and diplomas on the wall. But I've also 
                    discovered that people treat you differently, or at least listen 
                    to you differently, when you have those things. For some people, 
                    they would then be driven to succeed by pride (that's the 
                    materialism that I hate). But for me, with my overactive-
                    from-childhood mind, I would lay awake in bed at night or ride 
                    in the back of the car and plot how to fix the world in virutally 
                    every aspect of life. I'm not saying this to be proud at all 
                    because goodness knows it's as much a curse as it is a blessing, 
                    but by 15 years of age I was already a musician, engineer, 
                    psychologist, counselor, architect, author, philosopher, event 
                    planner, entrepreneur, business manager, IT technician, 
                    doctor, and more, and had mental experience in every one of the 
                    C-suite categories. College is just giving me the words to explain 
                    everything that's been on my mind for the past 10 years. But the 
                    problem is, in this world today you can have inherent knowledge, 
                    and it can be just as good as learned knowledge, but nobody takes 
                    you seriously because you have nothing to prove that your inherent 
                    knowledge actually exists. So - the solution is education. 
                    Which is kinda unfortunate because it does waste a lot of your time. 
                    But the other thing that's been dawning on me over the past several 
                    years, is that school is actually really easy. You don't actually 
                    need to force all that unhelpful knowledge into your mind for it 
                    to become a part of you; school is literally just about meeting 
                    deadlines, learning how to summarize things, and quoting key phrases. 
                    So basically if you summarize and quote and just do what you're 
                    supposed to - be a responsible human - and end with turning in your 
                    assignment on time - especially if the class has extra credit assignments 
                    - you don't even need to waste that much time and mental power on 
                    the things that are unhelpful to you; you're basically automatically 
                    going to be an A student. And then - the cool thing is, it's totally 
                    just a cause-and-effect: you do what you're supposed to, you get an 
                    A, you earn a diploma, people take you seriously. And along the way, 
                    you don't even have to waste very much brainpower, and you can find 
                    the words to define both your own brain and the world. A pretty good 
                    deal, if you ask me...

                <h2>Summer's Over</h2>
                <h5>Tuesday, August 26, 2025 @ 3:43pm</h5>
                <p>The summer is over.</p>
                <p>This summer I went to Alaska, Washington, and Colorado. 
                    I watched my best friend get married and worked at three 
                    weeks of summer camp. I made more friends than I've ever 
                    made in one summer and I was away from home more than I 
                    was at it.
                </p>
                <p>To be honest, I'm ready to be back home. I'm kinda tired :) 
                    And those long days of watching lectures and typing up 
                    assignments, wrapped in my blanket and curled up in my 
                    desk chair, honestly sound pretty inviting.

                <h2>Learning How to Study</h2>
                <h5>Monday, June 9, 2025 @ 10:34am</h5>
                <p>Today I studied for my doula refresher, took the exam, 
                    and passed it. And as I locked in, scrolled through the 
                    pages of reading assignments, and took notes, I realized 
                    something: I actually like studying.
                </p>
                <p>It certainly wasn't always that way. And I'm still not 
                    exactly sure what changed. But I'm happy to announce to 
                    the world that I think I have finally learned how to study.
                </p>
                <p>But because I know that someone somewhere needs to know 
                    exactly what they can do to love studying more, and because 
                    I also know that, as they say, I don't truly know something 
                    unless I can explain it to someone else, I will try to put 
                    some thoughts into words anyway of reasons why I like studying 
                    now.
                </p>
                <p>First, you have to get the method and rhythm down. Look over 
                    the requirements for the assignment. Start reading, take notes. 
                    Read, take notes. Read, take notes. Or watch, if it's a video. 
                    Get in the groove; maybe listen to some music.
                </p>
                <p>Then, I've discovered, it helps to romanticize studying. Pretend 
                    you're a student in the royal college library; the walls are marble and 
                    paneling, and paintings of kings hang on the walls. Of course, 
                    to imagine that, you have to play the part too. Put on some 
                    posh, cozy clothes; pour yourself a cup of hot chocolate or tea; 
                    switch your music to classical.
                </p>
                <p>And most importantly, clean your room. Make your bed. You can't 
                    work in a messy room. Your brain may still be screaming about all 
                    the other, more fun things you could be doing, but with a clean 
                    room it has a lot less to scream about. Those things can wait 
                    while this student is studying in the royal library...

                <p>I genuinely think I have the best classrooms in the world. 
                    Seriously, whose classrooms the past few days can compare

                <h5>Thursday, March 13, 2025 @ 9:48am</h5>
                <p>Today I'm remembering back to the hardest semester 
                    of my life: spring 2023. That semester I had a particularly 
                    heavy class load. We had just moved halfway across the country, 
                    and while I was happy to be in our new state, everything 
                    that was going on was overwhelming to me. It was my second semester 
                    of for-real college, and I didn't really know how to study. I was 
                    trying to make new friends and settle into our new state. I was 
                    struggling with chronic anxiety and panic attacks that had flared up 
                    with the move, and stress over a volunteer accounting job that I was trying 
                    to learn without any training. One of my math classes had a horrible 
                    teacher who gave the hardest assignments I'd imagined possible; my 
                    grandpa died halfway through the semester; my family had to move 
                    my grandma, who came to live with us; and I went through a 
                    hard, confusing sorta-breakup - all during that spring semester.
                </p>
                <p>But I made it. That's the important thing. And when I've already 
                    been through the hardest part, it's comforting to know that it 
                    can only get better from here.
